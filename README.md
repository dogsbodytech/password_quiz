Start with `python server.py`

ToDo
* Somehow stop rude words being shown on the large screen
* Get browser not to autocomplete form feilds
* Better HTML for all pages
* Form feilds need to limit input size and alpha-numeric? Not security, just for ease
* I really wish that I could get /logo.png & /bootstrap.min.css to be cached by the browser
